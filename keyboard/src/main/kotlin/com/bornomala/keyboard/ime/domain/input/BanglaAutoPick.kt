     * The word to commit on space, or null to keep exactly what was typed. In order:
     *
     *  1. the user's own earlier pick for this exact spelling — an explicit choice, always honoured;
     *  2. a whole-word [word] match — an English loanword (`chair` -> চেয়ার) or an Avro spelling
     *     fix (`beshI` -> বেশি). When the typed spelling already renders a real *dictionary* word
     *     it is applied only if it is the more frequent of the two: `karon` -> কারণ swaps, but
     *     `nice` keeps নিচে and `apon` keeps আপন, with the match offered one tap away. A rendering
     *     the keyboard has merely *learned* does not count: an earlier miss (e.g. চম্পুতের committed
     *     where the loanword could not apply) must not block কম্পিউটার forever. A user who really
     *     wants that rendering taps it once, which records a pick (rule 1);
     *  3. the top *trusted* phonetic-dictionary word, withheld when the roman is still too short to
     *     be a finished word or when the transliteration is itself a known word — learned or not,
     *     since then it is not a misspelling to fix. Suggest-only candidates count as known words
     *     for that check but are never auto-picked.
