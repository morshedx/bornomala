 * candidates, ranks them, and returns the top [SuggestionRequest.limit]. It also
 * forwards learning signals to providers on word commit.
 *
 * All methods are `suspend` and must be invoked off the main thread by the caller's
 * coroutine. The engine itself performs no main-thread work and allocates lazily.
